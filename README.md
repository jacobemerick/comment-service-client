# jacobemerick/comment-service-client

This is an auto-generated client for jacobemerick/comment-service, built by swagger-api/swagger-codegen. It is located under version control to help with my semi-working build system and to help contain potential breaking changes.

## Client Generation
1. Install swagger-codegen if needed
    ```
    $ brew install swagger-codegen
    ```
1. Install composer if needed [download instructions](https://getcomposer.org/download/)
1. Run generation script
    ```
    $ bash bin/generate-client.sh
    ```

If there are any issues during installation you can run the script in the sh file with a `-v` flag for verbose output.
